Python Challenges - Py Me Up, Charlie

PyBank
We were asked to write a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company using the financial data provided in the data set named budget_data.csv. The dataset contained two columns: Month & Year and Profit/Losses.

The Python script should analyze the financial records and arrive at the below conclusions:
-	The total number of months included in the dataset
-	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-	The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll
We were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process by writing a Python script for analyzing the election records using the poll data provided in the data set named election_data.csv. The dataset contained three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The Python script should analyze the poll data and arrive at the below conclusions:
-	The total number of votes cast
-	A complete list of candidates who received votes
-	The percentage of votes each candidate won
-	The total number of votes each candidate won
-	The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, the final scripts should both publish the analysis to the terminal as well as export a text file with the results.
